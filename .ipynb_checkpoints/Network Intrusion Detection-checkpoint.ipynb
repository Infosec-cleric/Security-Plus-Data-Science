    "# Network Intrusion Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Network Intrusion Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Misuse Detection\n",
    "    * Exact descriptions of known bad behavior\n",
    "* Anomaly detection\n",
    "    * Deviations from profiles of normal behavior\n",
    "    * First proposed in 1987 by Dorothy Denning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why ML for security: Attack landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attack sophistication\n",
    "    * 403M new variants of malware created in 2011\n",
    "    * 100K unique malware samples daily in 2012 Q1\n",
    "* Required attacker knowledge decreasing\n",
    "* Highly motivated attackers\n",
    "\n",
    "### FACT\n",
    "* Almost all NIDS systems used in operational environments are misuse-based\n",
    "    * Despite lots of research on anomaly detection\n",
    "    * Despite appeal of anomaly detection to find new attacks\n",
    "    * Despite success of ML in other domains\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "* Outliers detection\n",
    "* High cost of errors\n",
    "* Lack of appropriate training data\n",
    "* Interpretation of results\n",
    "* Variability in network traffic\n",
    "* Adaptive adversaries\n",
    "* Evaluation difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge: Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training Sample - Classification\n",
    "    * Many from both classes\n",
    "* Required quality - Classification\n",
    "    * Enough to distinguish two classes\n",
    "* Training Sample - Outlier Detection\n",
    "    * Almost all from one class\n",
    "* Required quality - Outlier Detection\n",
    "    * Perfect model of normal\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Premise: Anomaly detection can find novel attacks\n",
    "* Fact: ML is better at finding similar patterns than at finding outliers\n",
    "    * Example: recommend similar products; similarity: products purchased together\n",
    "* Conclusion: ML is better for finding variants of know attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underlying assumptions\n",
    "    * Malicious activity is anomalous\n",
    "    * Anomalies correspond to malicious activity\n",
    "* Do these assumptions hold?\n",
    "    * Former employee requests authorization code\n",
    "        * Account revocation bug? Insider threat?\n",
    "        * Username typo\n",
    "    * User authentication fails 10k times\n",
    "        * Brute force attack\n",
    "        * User changed password, forgot to update script\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Challenge: High Cost of Errors\n",
    "* Product Recommendation - Cost of False Negatives\n",
    "    * Low: potential missed sales\n",
    "* Production Recommendation - Cost of False Positives\n",
    "    * Low: continue shopping\n",
    "* Spam Detection - Cost of False Negatives\n",
    "    * Low: spam finding way to inbox\n",
    "* Spam detection - Cost of False Positives\n",
    "    * High: missed important email\n",
    "* Intrusion Detection - Cost of False NEgatives\n",
    "    * High: Arbitrary damage\n",
    "* Intrusion Detection - Cost of False Positives\n",
    "    * High: Wasted precious analylst time\n",
    "* Post-processing:\n",
    "    * Spelling/grammar checkers to clean up results\n",
    "    * Proofreading: much easier than verifying a network intrusion"
