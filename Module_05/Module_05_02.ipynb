Classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs. For example given an email, it will classify it as either spam or non-spam. Regression is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. For example, we could predict the value of a house based on number of bathrooms, number of square footage and etc.\n",
