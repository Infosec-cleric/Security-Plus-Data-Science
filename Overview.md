Security Plus Data Science

This is an interactive course, with the goal of teaching security
professionals how to implement data science techniques in order to
obtain valuable insights from their data. This course will encompass
various topics including: feature engineering, exploratory data
analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. The combination of
data science and security allows the security community to transform
assumptions, opinions and beliefs into knowledge. This two day course
teaches attendees the data science concepts, techniques and processes
for analyzing various security datasets.

Student Requirements: Technical Skills: No previous experience in data
science is necessary. High-level understanding of programming is
recommended.

Class Materials Needed: Students will be required to bring their own
laptops for the class. Laptops will need a VMWare Workstation or
VirtualBox installation with an install of any operating systems is
fine, as well as the installation of Python3 and Jupyter Notebooks. I
will provide a Ubuntu VM if necessary, all other tools will be
provided.
